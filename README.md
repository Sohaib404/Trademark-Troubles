# Trademark-Troubles

Created for HackED 2021

## Inspiration
We wanted to make a **fun party game** that we could quickly set up and play with our friends.

## What it does
Sets up and moderates a game where players create problematic prompts for other players to create a solution for. Inspired by Patently Stupid from Jackbox Games.

## How we built it
We used Python and the discordpy library. We also used google-cloud to host the discord bot to keep it online 24/7.

## How to Play
 - Use !play to join the game session.
 - Use !start to become the game master and start the game.
 - Use !submit <prompt> to create a prompt for others.
 - Use !done when you're all done submitting prompts.
 - Planning phase begins. Check private DM's and upload you Trademarks presentation. Texts and any Images can be used.
 - Use !done to end planning phase.
 - Presenting phase begins. Use !next to move to the next presenter/next slide.
 - Voting phase begins. Use !vote <num> to vote for the player with the best solution for their problem.

## What's next for Trademark Troubles!
Scale it up so that the bot can run multiple simultaneous games on different servers.
