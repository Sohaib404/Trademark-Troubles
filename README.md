# Trademark-Troubles

HackED 2021

## Inspiration
We wanted to make a fun party game that we could quickly set up and play with our friends.
## What it does
Sets up and moderates a game where players create problematic prompts for other players to create a solution for. 
## How we built it
Built using Python and the discordpy library. Used google-cloud to host our bot so it is available 24/7.
## What's next for Trademark Troubles!
Scale it up so that multiple simultaneous games can be played over different servers.
